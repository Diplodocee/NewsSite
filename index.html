        <h2>Pregnant <i>T. Rex</i> Discovered</h2>
        <p>Scientists examining the femur of a 68 million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex say they've confirmed that the creature was a mother-to-be. That would be a major find in the field of paleontology, where researchers are rarely able to determine a dinosaurs's sex.</p>
        <p>The team from North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences published its findings Tuesday in the journal Scientific Reports.
        “This analysis allows us to determine the gender of this fossil, and gives us a window into the evolution of egg-laying in modern birds," lead author Mary Schweitzer said in a statement. (Washington Post)

        <h2>New Dromaeosaurid: <i>Boreonykus certekorum</i></h2>
        <p>A new type of dromaeosaurid — <i>Boreonykus certekorum</i> — that thrived in the cold has been discovered in a remote part of Canada.</p>
        <p>Dr. Phil Bell from the University of New England and Dr. Philip Currie from the University of Alberta, announced the discovery of <i>Boreonykus certekorum</i> this week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.</p>
        <p>According to the team, this new dinosaur lived about 72 million years ago (Late Cretaceous period). The fossilized remains of the ancient animal were unearthed from the Wapiti Formation, near the city of Grande Prairie, central-western Alberta.</p>

        <h2>New Tyrannosaur: <i>Timurlengia euotica</i></h2>
        <p>A new dinosaur cousin of <i>T. rex</i> – named <i>Timurlengia euotica</i> — has been found in the Kyzylkum Desert, northern Uzbekistan.</p>
        <p><i>Timurlengia euotica</i> lived during the Cretaceous period, approximately 90 million years ago, according to an international team of paleontologists led by Dr. Steve Brusatte from the University of Edinburgh, UK.</p>
        <p>This species fills a 20 million year gap in the fossil record of tyrannosaurs — the iconic group of dinosaurian carnivores that includes <i>T. rex</i> and <i>Albertosaurus</i>, and provides key insights into how the group evolved.</p>

        <h2><i>Corythosaurus</i> skull scanned for 3D printing</h2>
        <p>It's not your typical patient. On Friday, a dinosaur skull underwent a CT scan at Powers Pet Emergency Hospital in Colorado Springs.</p>
        <p>Scientists from the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park performed the scan on a skull of a Corythosaurus. It's a large duck-billed dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Montana that dates back at least 75 million years.</p>
        <p>Paleontologist Matt Christopher say he'll combine the data from the CT scan with data from a surface laser-scan to create a 3D printable model of an entire Corythosaurus skull.</p>
        <p>At the center, they have a closely-related dinosaur, also from Montana's Late Cretaceous sediments that is a fairly complete, but doesn't have a head. They'll use the 3D printed copy of this skull, scaled to fit, to complete the specimen.</p>

        <h2>"Dinosaurs Among Us" opens at American Museum of Natural History</h2>
        <p>“Dinosaurs Among Us” – which runs through Jan. 2, 2017 – explores the fascinating connection between the captivating beasts that roamed the earth 170 million years ago and today’s birds.</p>
        <p>Visitors can clamber up and into a full-scale model of a dinosaur nest with 20 eggs, see a brooding Citipati protecting its eggs, gawk at fossils of dinosaurs and their embryos, inspect oodles of dinosaur models and use microscopes to learn about the “growth rings” of various dinosaur eggs.</p>
        <p>The largest dinosaur in the exhibit is the 1.5-ton Yutyrannus, which stood 23 feet tall and sported a shaggy coat of filaments called “protofeathers.” The smallest? The Anchiornis huxleyi, a theropod about the size of a pigeon, which boasted a beautiful collage of white feathers with black and an impressive crest of rust red plumes.</p>
        <p>The exhibition allows visitors to design eight different dinosaurs (including the “velociraptor mongoliensis” similar to the fictionalized creation in “Jurassic Park”) and digitally launch flight-worthy creations.</p>
